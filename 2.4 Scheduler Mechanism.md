# 🕒 Scheduler Mechanism

This document explains the scheduler functionality in the Poker Backend application, how it works, and how to add new scheduled jobs.

## 🔍 What is the Scheduler?

The scheduler in our backend is powered by APScheduler and is designed to run background tasks automatically on a specified schedule. It allows us to execute maintenance tasks, notifications, or other automated processes without any manual intervention.

**How the Scheduler Works**

1. Application Startup
    * When the Django application starts, it loads all installed apps—including the scheduler app.
    * Django calls the ready() method in app_scheduler/apps.py as part of the startup process.
2. Initialization & Configuration
    * The ready() method initializes an instance of APScheduler's BackgroundScheduler with the timezone set to Australia/Sydney.
    * A job store (DjangoJobStore) is configured to persist job details in the database, ensuring that job information survives a restart.
3. Job Registration
    * Functions that need to run on a schedule are defined in app_scheduler/jobs.py. These functions should be self-contained.
    * In the ready() method, each job function is registered using the scheduler.add_job() call.
    * Important parameters for add_job() include:
        * `func`: The function to be executed.
        * `trigger`: Determines when the job should run (e.g., IntervalTrigger, CronTrigger etc).
        * `id`: A unique identifier for the job.
        * `args/kwargs`: Arguments to pass to the job function.
        * `replace_existing` If set to True, replaces any existing job with the same ID.
        * `max_instances`: Limits how many instances of the job can run concurrently.
4. Execution
    * Once configured, the scheduler starts and executes the registered jobs in the background according to their triggers.

## 📁 Scheduler Files

#### 📌 jobs.py

This file contains all the functions that will be scheduled and executed by the scheduler. Each function should be self-contained and perform a specific task. Functions from this file are imported and added to the scheduler in the `ready()` method of the `AppSchedulerConfig` class.

**Parameters:**
- Job function parameters vary based on the specific job implementation

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `args` | list | Optional | Positional arguments to pass to the function |
| `kwargs` | dict | Optional | Keyword arguments to pass to the function |

**Expected Output:**
- No explicit return value required for most job functions
---

#### 📌 apps.py

This file contains the main app configuration class. The `ready()` method is automatically called by Django during startup and is where we initialize and start the scheduler. It imports various components from APScheduler and django-apscheduler, sets up the scheduler with the appropriate timezone, and adds a job store to persist jobs in the database.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `func` | function | Mandatory | The function to execute |
| `trigger` | trigger object | Mandatory | When to execute the job |
| `id` | string | Mandatory | Unique identifier for the job |
| `max_instances` | integer | Optional | Maximum number of concurrently running instances |
| `replace_existing` | boolean | Optional | Whether to replace an existing job with the same ID |
| `args` | list | Optional | Positional arguments to pass to the function |
| `kwargs` | dict | Optional | Keyword arguments to pass to the function |

**Expected Output:**
- The `ready()` method doesn't return any value
- The scheduler starts in the background and continues running as long as the Django application is running
- Registered jobs execute according to their trigger specifications

**Code Sample;**
```python
        scheduler.add_job(
            the_function_from_jobs.py,  
            trigger=IntervalTrigger(hours=24),  # Run once every 24 hours in this case
            id="unique_identifier_for_this_job",  
            max_instances=1,  # Only allow one instance to run at a time
            replace_existing=True,  # Replace if exists on app restart
            args=[game_id],  # Pass arguments to your function (game_id in this case)
        )
        
        # Start the scheduler
        scheduler.start()
```

#### 📌 models.py

This file would contain any custom models related to the scheduler. Typically, django-apscheduler provides all necessary models for job storage and execution tracking.

---

#### 📌 admin.py

This file registers models with the Django admin panel. For the scheduler, you typically don't need to add anything here as the django-apscheduler package handles its own models.

---

#### 📌 tests.py

This file contains unit tests for your scheduler jobs to ensure they work as expected. It's important to test your scheduler jobs because they run automatically in the background and errors might not be immediately apparent.

---

#### 📌 views.py

This file can contain API endpoints or Django views that allow you to manage scheduled jobs through a web interface. While most scheduler jobs run automatically based on their triggers, you might want to provide endpoints to create, update, or delete scheduled jobs programmatically.

## 💣 Common Trigger Types

The APScheduler library provides three main types of triggers:

#### ⏱️ Interval-Based Triggers

Run a job at fixed time intervals.

**Parameters**
| Parameter | Type     | Required | Description                             |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `seconds` | Integer  | Optional | Number of seconds between runs          |
| `minutes` | Integer  | Optional | Number of minutes between runs          |
| `hours`   | Integer  | Optional | Number of hours between runs            |
| `days`    | Integer  | Optional | Number of days between runs             |
| `weeks`   | Integer  | Optional | Number of weeks between runs            |
>**Note:** All parameters are optional, but at least one should be specified for meaningful scheduling.

**Code Sample;**
```python
from apscheduler.triggers.interval import IntervalTrigger

trigger = IntervalTrigger(hours=12)   # Every 12 hours
```
---

#### 💻 Cron-Based Triggers

Run a job on a specific schedule, similar to Unix cron.

**Parameters**
| Parameter      | Type            | Required | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `year`         | Integer/String   | Optional | Year to run (e.g., '2025')                   |
| `month`        | Integer/String   | Optional | Month to run (e.g., '1-12', '*/2')           |
| `day`          | Integer/String   | Optional | Day of month to run (e.g., '1-31', '*/5')    |
| `week`         | Integer/String   | Optional | Week of year to run                           |
| `day_of_week`  | Integer/String   | Optional | Day of week to run (e.g., '0-6', 'mon,wed,fri') |
| `hour`         | Integer/String   | Optional | Hour to run (e.g., '0-23', '*/3')            |
| `minute`       | Integer/String   | Optional | Minute to run (e.g., '0-59', '*/15')         |
| `second`       | Integer/String   | Optional | Second to run (e.g., '0-59', '*/30')         |
>Note: All parameters are optional, but at least one should be specified for meaningful scheduling.

**Code Sample;**
```python
from apscheduler.triggers.cron import CronTrigger

trigger = CronTrigger(year='2025', month='1-12', day='*/5', hour='0-23', minute='0-59', second='0-59')  # Every 5 days at any hour, minute, and second
```

#### 📆 Date Triggers

Use a Date Trigger when you want a job to run once at a specific date and time.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter      | Type            | Required  | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `run_date`     | datetime        | Mandatory | Exact date and time to run the job            |

**Code Sample;**
```python
from apscheduler.triggers.date import DateTrigger
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

tomorrow_noon = datetime.now().replace(hour=12, minute=0, second=0) + timedelta(days=1)

trigger = DateTrigger(run_date=tomorrow_noon)  # Run once at noon tomorrow
```
