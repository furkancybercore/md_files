# 🕒 Scheduler Mechanism

This document explains the scheduler functionality in the Poker Backend application, how it works, and how to add new scheduled jobs.

## 🔍 What is the Scheduler?

The scheduler in our backend is powered by APScheduler and is designed to run background tasks automatically on a specified schedule. It allows us to execute maintenance tasks, notifications, or other automated processes without any manual intervention.

**How the Scheduler Works**

1. Application Startup
    * When the Django application starts, it loads all installed apps—including the scheduler app.
    * Django calls the ready() method in app_scheduler/apps.py as part of the startup process.
2. Initialization & Configuration
    * The ready() method initializes an instance of APScheduler's BackgroundScheduler with the timezone set to Australia/Sydney.
    * A job store (DjangoJobStore) is configured to persist job details in the database, ensuring that job information survives a restart.
3. Job Registration
    * Functions that need to run on a schedule are defined in app_scheduler/jobs.py. These functions should be self-contained.
    * In the ready() method, each job function is registered using the scheduler.add_job() call.
    * Important parameters for add_job() include:
        * `func`: The function to be executed.
        * `trigger`: Determines when the job should run (e.g., IntervalTrigger, CronTrigger etc).
        * `id`: A unique identifier for the job.
        * `args/kwargs`: Arguments to pass to the job function.
        * `replace_existing` If set to True, replaces any existing job with the same ID.
        * `max_instances`: Limits how many instances of the job can run concurrently.
4. Execution
    * Once configured, the scheduler starts and executes the registered jobs in the background according to their triggers.

## 📁 Scheduler Files

This section details the key Python files involved in the scheduling mechanism.

### 📌 jobs.py

Contains the functions executed by the scheduler.

#### ✨ generate_upcoming_game_sessions

- **Purpose:** Main scheduler job to automatically create future `GameSession` records for recurring games.
- **Runs:** Typically triggered by the scheduler (e.g., daily).
- **Logic:** Fetches non-"once" games and calls `create_sessions_for_game` for each within a defined lookahead period.

**Input Parameters:**
- None (when called by the scheduler).

**Expected Output:**
- Creates `GameSession` records in the database.

**Example Usage (Scheduler Setup):**
```python
# In apps.py
scheduler.add_job(
    generate_upcoming_game_sessions,
    trigger=CronTrigger(hour=5), # Example: Run daily at 5 AM
    id="generate_upcoming_game_sessions",
    # ... other options
)
```

---

#### ✨ create_sessions_for_game

- **Purpose:** Helper function to generate `GameSession` records for a *specific* game based on its recurrence rules over a list of dates.
- **Runs:** Called by `generate_upcoming_game_sessions`.
- **Logic:** Checks recurrence (`daily`, `weekly`, etc.), day constraints, and prevents duplicates before creating sessions.

**Input Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type              | Description                                     |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `game`    | `Game` model instance | The game for which to create sessions.          |
| `days`    | list[`date`]      | List of candidate dates to check for sessions. |

**Expected Output:**
- Creates `GameSession` records in the database for the given game on valid dates.

**Example Usage (Conceptual):**
```python
from app_core.poker_event.models import Game
from datetime import date, timedelta

# Assuming 'my_game' is a Game instance
today = date.today()
next_week = [today + timedelta(days=i) for i in range(7)]

# Potentially called inside another function or script
create_sessions_for_game(my_game, next_week)
```

---

#### ✨ scheduled_job

- **Purpose:** Placeholder function for a scheduled job. Currently does nothing.
- **Runs:** Not currently scheduled in `apps.py`.

**Input Parameters:**
- None.

**Expected Output:**
- None.

**Example Usage:**
```python
def scheduled_job():
    """
    A scheduled job - currently empty.
    """
    pass # Add job logic here
```

---

### 📌 apps.py

Configures and initializes the APScheduler within the Django application context.

#### ✨ ready()

- This method is automatically called by Django when the application starts.
- Initializes the `BackgroundScheduler` with the 'Australia/Sydney' timezone.
- Configures `DjangoJobStore` to persist job states in the database.
- Registers scheduled jobs using `scheduler.add_job()`.
- Starts the scheduler process in the background.
- Includes logic to prevent the scheduler from starting multiple times in development environments (`runserver` with auto-reload).

**Input Parameters (for `scheduler.add_job`):**

| Parameter        | Type            | Required | Description                                              |
|------------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `func`           | function        | Yes      | The job function to execute (e.g., `generate_upcoming_game_sessions`). |
| `trigger`        | Trigger Object  | Yes      | Defines when the job runs (e.g., `CronTrigger`, `IntervalTrigger`). |
| `id`             | string          | Yes      | Unique identifier for the job.                           |
| `max_instances`  | integer         | No       | Maximum number of concurrent instances allowed.          |
| `replace_existing`| boolean         | No       | If `True`, replaces existing job with the same ID on restart. |
| `args`           | list            | No       | Positional arguments for the job function.               |
| `kwargs`         | dict            | No       | Keyword arguments for the job function.                  |

**Expected Output:**
- The `ready()` method itself doesn't return a value.
- A background scheduler thread is started.
- Registered jobs (like `generate_upcoming_game_sessions`) will execute automatically based on their defined triggers.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# poker-backend/backend/app_scheduler/apps.py - Inside ready()

scheduler.add_job(
    generate_upcoming_game_sessions,
    trigger=CronTrigger(hour=5),  # Run daily at 5 AM Sydney time
    id="generate_upcoming_game_sessions",
    max_instances=1,
    replace_existing=True,
)

try:
    scheduler.start()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error starting scheduler: {e}")
```

```
// Expected Outcome
- Scheduler process running in the background.
- The 'generate_upcoming_game_sessions' job is registered and will run daily at 5 AM.
- Job details are stored in Django's database via DjangoJobStore.
```

### 📌 models.py

This file would contain any custom models related to the scheduler. Typically, django-apscheduler provides all necessary models for job storage and execution tracking.

---

### 📌 admin.py

This file registers models with the Django admin panel. For the scheduler, you typically don't need to add anything here as the django-apscheduler package handles its own models.

---

### 📌 tests.py

This file contains unit tests for your scheduler jobs to ensure they work as expected. It's important to test your scheduler jobs because they run automatically in the background and errors might not be immediately apparent.

---

### 📌 views.py

This file can contain API endpoints or Django views that allow you to manage scheduled jobs through a web interface. While most scheduler jobs run automatically based on their triggers, you might want to provide endpoints to create, update, or delete scheduled jobs programmatically.

## 💣 Common Trigger Types

The APScheduler library provides three main types of triggers:

### ⏱️ Interval-Based Triggers

Run a job at fixed time intervals.

**Parameters**
| Parameter | Type     | Required | Description                             |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `seconds` | Integer  | Optional | Number of seconds between runs          |
| `minutes` | Integer  | Optional | Number of minutes between runs          |
| `hours`   | Integer  | Optional | Number of hours between runs            |
| `days`    | Integer  | Optional | Number of days between runs             |
| `weeks`   | Integer  | Optional | Number of weeks between runs            |
>**Note:** All parameters are optional, but at least one should be specified for meaningful scheduling.

**Code Sample;**
```python
from apscheduler.triggers.interval import IntervalTrigger

trigger = IntervalTrigger(hours=12)   # Every 12 hours
```
---

### 💻 Cron-Based Triggers

Run a job on a specific schedule, similar to Unix cron.

**Parameters**
| Parameter      | Type            | Required | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `year`         | Integer/String   | Optional | Year to run (e.g., '2025')                   |
| `month`        | Integer/String   | Optional | Month to run (e.g., '1-12', '*/2')           |
| `day`          | Integer/String   | Optional | Day of month to run (e.g., '1-31', '*/5')    |
| `week`         | Integer/String   | Optional | Week of year to run                           |
| `day_of_week`  | Integer/String   | Optional | Day of week to run (e.g., '0-6', 'mon,wed,fri') |
| `hour`         | Integer/String   | Optional | Hour to run (e.g., '0-23', '*/3')            |
| `minute`       | Integer/String   | Optional | Minute to run (e.g., '0-59', '*/15')         |
| `second`       | Integer/String   | Optional | Second to run (e.g., '0-59', '*/30')         |
>Note: All parameters are optional, but at least one should be specified for meaningful scheduling.

**Code Sample;**
```python
from apscheduler.triggers.cron import CronTrigger

trigger = CronTrigger(year='2025', month='1-12', day='*/5', hour='0-23', minute='0-59', second='0-59')  # Every 5 days at any hour, minute, and second
```

---
### 📆 Date Triggers

Use a Date Trigger when you want a job to run once at a specific date and time.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter      | Type            | Required  | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `run_date`     | datetime        | Mandatory | Exact date and time to run the job            |

**Code Sample;**
```python
from apscheduler.triggers.date import DateTrigger
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

tomorrow_noon = datetime.now().replace(hour=12, minute=0, second=0) + timedelta(days=1)

trigger = DateTrigger(run_date=tomorrow_noon)  # Run once at noon tomorrow
```
